To be bold I would say that JavaScript has become a really exiting programming language lately. And since huge apps are done completely in JavaScript, so called one-view apps, the need for structure is very important. This is where frameworks like Backbone.js, Sammy and Spine can be of much help. 

I have used Sammy for some projects, and I loved it, but for the last tree months I have been on a team where we have been developing a big app, and we used Backbone.js. This blog-post is meant to tell you about some of our experiences, some pit-falls that are easy to drop into, and how you can (if you want to) structure your Backbone app.

First of, there are many blog-posts about how to structure your app with modules, so you should read about this before moving on in this blog-post. Here are some of them:
